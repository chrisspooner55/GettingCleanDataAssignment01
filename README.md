### Introduction

This project contains an R file called run_analysis.R that processes raw sensor data 
obtained from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The data includes the mean and standard 
deviation of observations that are measured from the accelerometer and gyro sensors in 
the phone. Each measurement relates to a particular subject and the type of activity the 
subject was doing.

The final processed tidy data presents the mean of all the measured variables for each 
subject and the activity.

###Running the run_analysis.R
